Log a Support Incident with SAP Product Support and ask for the business toggle IMPLEMENT_WORKAROUND_FOR_SCIM_GROUPS to be turned on. Mention SAP KBA 2857395 and the SAP Analytics Cloud Service URL in the incident.

Once SAP Product Support have confirmed the business toggle IMPLEMENT_WORKAROUND_FOR_SCIM_GROUPS is ON, then and only then create 5 teams but importantly withOUT creating the team folder when you create the team. 
You must deselect the 'Create a Folder' option.


Create 5 teams with the names:


Admins
Users
Content_Admins
Content_Viewers
Content_Editors



The team names are used in the next steps, so if you give them different names you must change their names in the subsequent steps too
